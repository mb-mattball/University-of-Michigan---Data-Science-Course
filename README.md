# University-of-Michigan---Data-Science-Course
I completed the following data science course on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/home/week/1
This mostly involved data processing and data preperation, it helped improve the speed of my coding skills and familiarise me with Python syntax
